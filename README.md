# OneDriverDownloader

There is no way to share a direct download link from OneDrive,
so this app gets the direct download link from a sharing link.

I included a program that you can use to download a file,
but the intention is that you include `OneDriverDownloader` project/class in your program and use that.
This program is also useful for demonstrating usage.

You're free to use it as you like,
but it would be nice if you could tell me if you find it useful :)
